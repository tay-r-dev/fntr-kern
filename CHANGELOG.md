- [cross-axis mappings] When creating a new cross-axis mapping, make sure it is in view by scrolling to the end. This improves the experience when there are many mappings. [PR 2610](https://github.com/fontra/fontra/pull/2610)

## 2026-05-12 [version 2026.5.1]

### New features

- [Designspace navigation panel] Add a new accordion section for hidden axes. Add an associated view option (under its hamburger menu button) "Show only effective location", similar to "Show effective location", but that will only show (inactive) sliders for the effective location. This is useful when the hidden axes are all controlled by the non-hidden axes via cross-axis mappings (aka `avar-2`). [Issue 2553](https://github.com/fontra/fontra/issues/2553), [PR 2584](https://github.com/fontra/fontra/pull/2584)
- [Axes panel] Add "Hidden" checkbox to Axis box and New Axis dialog, so we can finally edit the "hidden" axis flag. [Issue 1373](https://github.com/fontra/fontra/issues/1373), [PR 2582](https://github.com/fontra/fontra/pull/2582)

### Improvements

- [front-end code] Our highly competent contributor Qwerasd started to convert part of the front-end code base from JavaScript to TypeScript. This process will in the long term improve maintainability and stability. [PR 2585](https://github.com/fontra/fontra/pull/2585), [PR 2590](https://github.com/fontra/fontra/pull/2590)

### Fixes

- [fontra-pak] Fix "Open fonts in read-only mode" on Windows: this new checkbox sometimes had an unpredictable effect. [PR 249](https://github.com/fontra/fontra-pak/pull/249)

## 2026-05-06 [version 2026.5.0]

### New features

- [fontra pak] Add a checkbox to the launcher window that (when checked) causes fonts to be opened in read-only mode. [fontra-pak Issue 247](https://github.com/fontra/fontra-pak/issues/247), [fontra-pak PR 248](https://github.com/fontra/fontra-pak/pull/248), [PR 2581](https://github.com/fontra/fontra/pull/2581)

- [shaping] When the "Apply text shaping and features" option is _off_, don't do any positioning emulation. [Issue 2517](https://github.com/fontra/fontra/issues/2517), [PR 2571](https://github.com/fontra/fontra/pull/2571)
- [shaping debugger] Improved message formatting in feature debugger. Contributed by Khaled Hosny. [PR 2566](https://github.com/fontra/fontra/pull/2566)
- [opentype feature editor] When navigating to a line from an error message or from the shaping debugger, scroll the selected line into the center of the view like most editors do, instead of near the edge. Contributed by Khaled Hosny. [PR 2565](https://github.com/fontra/fontra/pull/2565)

### Fixes

- [editor view] Fix inconsistent advance widths for undefined glyphs. [Issue 2572](https://github.com/fontra/fontra/issues/2572), [PR 2575](https://github.com/fontra/fontra/pull/2575)
- [editor view] Fix display glitch with Safari on very large screens. Contributed by Qwerasd. [PR 2567](https://github.com/fontra/fontra/pull/2567)
- [fontra-glyphs] Use the correct encoding when reading .plist files. This fixes read errors with certain .glyphs and .glyphspackage files. [fontra-glyphs Issue 140](https://github.com/fontra/fontra-glyphs/issues/140), [fontra-glyphs PR 141](https://github.com/fontra/fontra-glyphs/pull/141)

## 2026-04-29 [version 2026.4.4]

### New features

- [Windows installer] Add option to add a desktop shortcut. [fontra-pak Issue 239](https://github.com/fontra/fontra-pak/issues/239), [fontra-pak PR 240](https://github.com/fontra/fontra-pak/pull/240)

### Fixes

- [fontra-pak] Reinstate export as .rcjk. This was accidentally removed when .rcjk was removed as an option for new fonts. [fontra-pak PR 244](https://github.com/fontra/fontra-pak/pull/244)
- [rcjk] Fix .rcjk export by ignoring empty conditional substitutions. [PR 2557](https://github.com/fontra/fontra/pull/2557)
- [conditional substitutions] Fix axis (`avar`) mapping logic for conditional substitutions. Previously Fontra could substitute glyphs at not quite the correct locations, if an axis had an `avar` mapping. [Issue 2556](https://github.com/fontra/fontra/issues/2556), [PR 2558](https://github.com/fontra/fontra/pull/2558)
- [conditional substitutions] Fix previewing behavior when a rule has multiple condition sets. [build-shaper-font Issue 30](https://github.com/fontra/build-shaper-font/issues/30), [build-shaper-font PR 31](https://github.com/fontra/build-shaper-font/pull/31)

## 2026-04-15 [version 2026.4.3]

### New features

- [shaping debugger] Link lookups back to the feature source code, via the `Debg` table. [PR 2550](https://github.com/fontra/fontra/pull/2550)

### Fixes

- [opentype backend] When reading .ttf or .otf, don't error when the font has an older version of the OS/2 table. [Issue 2548](https://github.com/fontra/fontra/issues/2548), [PR 2549](https://github.com/fontra/fontra/pull/2549)

## 2026-04-14 [version 2026.4.2]

- [fontra-pak Windows] Add an .msi installer to the release assets. Contributed by Dr Anirban Mitra [fontra-pak Issue 209](https://github.com/fontra/fontra-pak/issues/209), [fontra-pak PR 238](https://github.com/fontra/fontra-pak/pull/238)

## 2026-04-08 [version 2026.4.1]

### New features

- Add support for conditional substitutions, or "designspace rules". This allows Fontra to view these substitutions from .designspace or .fontra files. A user interface to _author_ these rules will follow later. [Issue 2460](https://github.com/fontra/fontra/issues/2460), [PR 2539](https://github.com/fontra/fontra/pull/2539)
- [pointer tool] Convert a line to a curve with alt-click (eliminating the need to switch to the pen tool for this) [PR 2538](https://github.com/fontra/fontra/pull/2538)

### Fixes

- [font overview] Accept the alt/option key as a modifier to toggle the glyph selection (when clicking or dragging). This can already be done with the command/Windows/meta key, but that has an annoying side effect on Windows. [Issue 2536](https://github.com/fontra/fontra/issues/2536), [PR 2537](https://github.com/fontra/fontra/pull/2537)

## 2026-04-01 [version 2026.4.0]

### New features

- [fontra-pak] Add "Download latest Fontra Pak" button for Linux platform. Contributed by Dr Anirban Mitra. [PR 233](https://github.com/fontra/fontra-pak/pull/233)
- [fontra-pak] Added "Webfont" (.woff2) export option. Contributed by Dr Anirban Mitra. [PR 232](https://github.com/fontra/fontra-pak/pull/232)
- Added a "Shaping debugger", as part of the "Input characters and output glyphs" panel. It sits in a new closed-by-default accordion item between "Input characters" and "Output glyphs" and allows the user to step through all the processing steps involved with text shaping and OpenType feature application, such as character reordering, glyph substition and glyph positioning. The user can see what effect each step has on the rendered string, both visually in the canvas and textually/numerically in the output glyphs list. This builds on the HarfBuzz "message API", and offers similar functionality to the [Crowbar](https://github.com/simoncozens/crowbar) tool. [PR 2500](https://github.com/fontra/fontra/pull/2500)

### Improvements

- Improved browser tab management significantly: when navigating to the font info view or to the font overview, activate an existing tab for that view. This avoids opening redundant new tabs, and allows the user to switch tabs with the "Font" menu. [PR 2520](https://github.com/fontra/fontra/pull/2520)

### Fixes

- [ufo] Prevent ufo write error and export error when a path contains an invalid number of subsequent cubic off-curve points. [PR 2529](https://github.com/fontra/fontra/pull/2529)
- [shaping] Fixed emulated mark positioning around "multiplied" glyph. [Issue 2521](https://github.com/fontra/fontra/issues/2521), [PR 2523](https://github.com/fontra/fontra/pull/2523)
- Prevent editing of metrics and kerning when the font is read-only, and prevent editing metrics when glyphs are locked. [Issue 2407](https://github.com/fontra/fontra/issues/2407), [PR 2513](https://github.com/fontra/fontra/pull/2513)

## 2026-03-24 [version 2026.3.5]

### New features

- [fontra-pak] Make .fontra the default format when creating a new font, and remove the .rcjk legacy format from the new font format options. [fontra-pak PR 231](https://github.com/fontra/fontra-pak/pull/231)
- [translations] Added Tagalog (Filipino) translations, contributed by FlaviusChromacitrin. [Issue 2503](https://github.com/fontra/fontra/issues/2503), [PR 2506](https://github.com/fontra/fontra/pull/2506)

### Fixes

- [Windows + OneDrive] Work around erroneous reloads that disrupt editing, caused by OneDrive on Windows: if files are stored in a OneDrive folder, each file write by Fontra causes OneDrive to change the modification time again a bit later, causing Fontra to receive a "file changed" event, even though the file didn't really change. We work around this by also comparing the contents of the file, and ignore the event if it's still the same. [PR 2511](https://github.com/fontra/fontra/pull/2511)
- [shaping] Make explicit non-mark glyph category take precedence over ad-hoc mark detection. [Issue 2507](https://github.com/fontra/fontra/issues/2507), [PR 2508](https://github.com/fontra/fontra/pull/2508)
- [designspace/ufo] Don't unnecessarily modify UFO's metainfo.plist file when reading. This happened when the metainfo.plist file was formatted differently from how fontTools.ufoLib would do it. [Issue 2504](https://github.com/fontra/fontra/issues/2504), [PR 2505](https://github.com/fontra/fontra/pull/2505)
- [fontra-glyphs] Fixed support for smart components that don't respond to font axes, yet use master layers that do. Reported and mostly fixed by Zachary Quinn Scheuren. [fontra-glyphs PR 133](https://github.com/fontra/fontra-glyphs/pull/133) and [fontra-glyphs PR 134](https://github.com/fontra/fontra-glyphs/pull/134)
- [ttx] Fixed .ttx support for fonts that contain a format 2 `post` table. [PR 2501](https://github.com/fontra/fontra/pull/2501)

## 2026-03-17 [version 2026.3.4]

### Fixes

- [shaping] A GDEF table in the feature code must override our own glyph-is-mark logic. [Issue 2495](https://github.com/fontra/fontra/issues/2495), [PR 2496](https://github.com/fontra/fontra/pull/2496)
- [cross-axis mapping/avar-2] Fix edge case where we specify an output axis value at the default, while the corresponding input value is _not_ at the default. [PR 2492](https://github.com/fontra/fontra/pull/2492)
- Prevent unnecessary .designspace lib pollution by not writing the "project glyph sets" list if it is empty. [PR 2491](https://github.com/fontra/fontra/pull/2491)
- Fixed write-on-initial-read bug that was especially harmful for .designspace: Fontra should never write files when it is only reading. [PR 2499](https://github.com/fontra/fontra/pull/2499)

## 2026-03-12 [version 2026.3.3]

- Fix font info navigation regression.

## 2026-03-12 [version 2026.3.2]

### New features

- [shaping] Add app-level switch to opt-out of ad hoc mark detection. This setting is needed to correctly render glyphs that use "receiving" marks (starting with an underscore) that are not meant to be marks. The default behavior still matches fontmake's default. [Issue 2487](https://github.com/fontra/fontra/issues/2487), [PR 2490](https://github.com/fontra/fontra/pull/2490)
- [editor] Bring the "glyph sets" functionality from the font overview to the editor. The glyph set selection UI was added to the glyph search panel. Importantly, this finally allows us to use custom glyph name/code point mappings in the editor. [PR 2489](https://github.com/fontra/fontra/pull/2489)
- [translations] Added a full Traditional Chinese set of translation strings, contributed by 湖远星（Lake桑）. They also filled some gaps in the Simplified Chinese strings. [PR 2479](https://github.com/fontra/fontra/pull/2479)
- [fontra-pak] Add a sample text field to the launcher window. If this is empty, launch into the font overview, but if it is not, launch into the editor with the text. [fontra-pak PR 228](https://github.com/fontra/fontra-pak/pull/228)

### Fixes

- Don't draw incorrect placeholder strings for empty unencoded glyphs [PR 2486](https://github.com/fontra/fontra/pull/2486)
- [fontra-pak] Reinstate support for macOS 11, which was accidentally dropped by unnecessarily upgrading the PyQt6 dependency. [fontra-pak PR 229](https://github.com/fontra/fontra-pak/pull/229)
- [opentype] Use the previous working shaper font if compilation fails during editing of OpenType features. This avoids jarring text breackage during feature editing. [Issue 2469](https://github.com/fontra/fontra/issues/2469), [PR 2480](https://github.com/fontra/fontra/pull/2480)

## 2026-03-06 [version 2026.3.1]

- Fix editing kerning and sidebearings, making the glyph list metrics update correctly when using these tools. [PR 2468](https://github.com/fontra/fontra/pull/2468)

## 2026-03-06 [version 2026.3.0]

- [OpenType] Initial support for OpenType features has landed! This requires a longer explanation, but in short:
  - Fontra will now apply text shaping and OpenType features. The user interface for this lives in the text entry panel.
  - Fontra now uses HarfBuzz for text shaping and OpenType features, via [harfbuzzjs](https://github.com/harfbuzz/harfbuzzjs). Khaled Hosny contributed many improvements to `harfbuzzjs` to make this possible.
  - For `.otf` and `.ttf` fonts, Fontra will use the actual OpenType features from the fonts.
  - For source files (`.designspace`, `.ufo`, `.glyphs`, `.fontra`), it will compile a so called "shaper font" on the fly, using the brand new [build-shaper-font](https://github.com/fontra/build-shaper-font) functionality, written by Khaled Hosny, using parts of the `fontc` code base written in Rust. This runs in the browser using Web Assembly. It is amazing.
  - Some glyph positioning features are emulated on the fly using data in the font: `curs`, `kern`, `mark` and `mkmk`. This uses live kerning data and glyph anchors and allows the user to make edit and immediately see the effects in the rendered text.
  - The OpenType feature code editor was improved to do live error checking and reporting (also using the `build-shaper-font` functionality). You can have two windows or tabs side-by-side, and see changes in the feature code being reflected in the glyph editor virtually instantaneously.
  - There is a new right sidebar panel called "Input characters and output glyphs" that contains two lists:
    - The input characters, and a little bit of unicode information for each character
    - The output glyphs, showing the glyph name, advance width, positioning offsets and character cluster index for each glyph.
  - There are still some open issues, and things may still be a little rough around the edges. See [Issue 2381](https://github.com/fontra/fontra/issues/2381) for past and ongoing work.

- Fixed two regressions with the font sources panel and designspace files that were introduced with version `2025.12.0` ([PR 2333](https://github.com/fontra/fontra/pull/2333)):
  - Fix "unknown kerning identifier" error when creating a new font source
  - Fix warning when a sparse (designspace) source cannot be made not sparse

## 2025-12-02 [version 2025.12.0]

- [editor] Fix UI glitch where "select all" could unexpectedly cause all UI text to be selected instead of doing "select all" in the editor. [PR 2332](https://github.com/fontra/fontra/pull/2332)
- [font sources] Prompt the user with a warning when toggling the "Is sparse" source checkbox. Part of [PR 2331](https://github.com/fontra/fontra/pull/2331).
- [kerning] Various kerning improvements ([PR 2324](https://github.com/fontra/fontra/pull/2324)):
  - Bring Fontra's kerning behavior in line with how fontmake treats designspace/ufo: every non-sparse source participates, falling back to zeros when values are missing
  - Fix a bug that allowed adding kerning to sparse sources
  - Improve "insert interpolated kerning source" so it will keep sparse kerning exceptions as sparse as possible
- [font overview] Distinguish more clearly between glyphs that exist and glyphs that do not exist in the font. Additionally, display the fallback glyph in _existing_ but _empty_ glyphs, both in the font overview and in the editor view. [Issue 2311](https://github.com/fontra/fontra/issues/2311), [PR 2313](https://github.com/fontra/fontra/pull/2313)
- Prevent deletion or deactivation of last active glyph source. This prevents confusing behavior. [Issue 2321](https://github.com/fontra/fontra/issues/2321), [PR 2322](https://github.com/fontra/fontra/pull/2322)
- Improve the "just start editing and the glyph source will come into existence" behavior for these cases ([PR 2319](https://github.com/fontra/fontra/pull/2319)):
  - Dragging the selection bounds handles to scale or rotate
  - Using various items in the Selection Transformation panel
- [font sources panel] Make source name list and source info panel scroll independently. [Issue 2318](https://github.com/fontra/fontra/issues/2318)
- Add "Is Sparse" checkbox to the font source UI. A "sparse" font source does not participate in kerning and in line metrics. (Part of the designspace PR mentioned below)
- In the sources panel, the default source name is now highlighted in bold. (Part of the designspace PR mentioned below)
- [designspace] Synchronize "sparse master" behavior with fontmake's behavior: if a `<source>` element has a `layer` attribute, consider the source "sparse". (Fontra's old behavior only considered sources sparse when the layer attribute was present _and_ differed from the default layer name.) [Issue 2314](https://github.com/fontra/fontra/issues/2314), [PR 2315](https://github.com/fontra/fontra/pull/2315)

## 2025-11-15 [version 2025.11.3]

- Improve pasting vector data from other applications. This is done by recognizing SVG data on the clipboard with type `image/svg+xml`. Previously Fontra only recognized SVG when it was on the `text/plain` clipboard, but not all applications provide that. [Issue 2032](https://github.com/fontra/fontra/issues/2032), [PR 2312](https://github.com/fontra/fontra/pull/2312)

## 2025-11-14 [version 2025.11.2]

- Fix some edge cases related to creating kerning exceptions
- Fix kerning pair deletion (there were some stale cache issues)
- Add explicit "Delete kerning pair" context menus for "all sources" and "this source"

## 2025-11-13 [version 2025.11.1]

- [fontra-pak] Issue releases instead of nightly builds. Fontra Pak releases use a [Calender Versioning](https://calver.org/) scheme: "YYYY.MM.PATCH" and can be [found here](https://github.com/fontra/fontra-pak/releases). So, with a GitHub account, you can now subscribe to release notifications by watching releases on the [fontra-pak repository](https://github.com/fontra/fontra-pak).
- Add support for sparse kerning exceptions. These are kerning exceptions that only exist in some locations and not all. [Issue 2305](https://github.com/fontra/fontra/issues/2305), [PR 2306](https://github.com/fontra/fontra/pull/2306)
- Improve support for global axes in variable components, by allowing the designer to override or fine-tune global axis values. The component sections in selection info panel now have a "hamburger" menu with some options: 1. Show global axes (as part of the component location) (default off), 2. Sort glyph axes (default on). Co-authored with NightFurySL2001. [Issue 2155](https://github.com/fontra/fontra/issues/2155), [PR 2276](https://github.com/fontra/fontra/pull/2276)

[Issue 2265](https://github.com/fontra/fontra/issues/2265), [PR 2266](https://github.com/fontra/fontra/pull/2266)
- [Transformations panel] Add "Type Enter to apply transformation" behavior to all numeric transformation fields. Typing Enter is often much more convenient than clicking the icon button. [PR 2266](https://github.com/fontra/fontra/pull/2266)

## 2025-08-26

- [designspace] Fixed a bug where adding a font source caused an error when writing kerning. [Issue 2263](https://github.com/fontra/fontra/issues/2263), [PR 2264](https://github.com/fontra/fontra/pull/2264)
- Fixed a bug where the glyph cells in the font overview would not respond to changes made in the editor. [Issue 2253](https://github.com/fontra/fontra/issues/2253), [PR 2262](https://github.com/fontra/fontra/pull/2262)

## 2025-08-19

- When adding a new font source, instantiate the kerning for the new location. [Issue 2252](https://github.com/fontra/fontra/issues/2252), [PR 2254](https://github.com/fontra/fontra/pull/2254)
- When deleting a font source, also delete associated kerning sources. [Issue 2255](https://github.com/fontra/fontra/issues/2255), [PR 2256](https://github.com/fontra/fontra/pull/2256)

## 2025-08-13

- Fixed a bug with pasting into a new glyph source (where the glyph source is created implicitly as part of the edit): the pasted item was added twice. [Issue 2241](https://github.com/fontra/fontra/issues/2241), [PR 2245](https://github.com/fontra/fontra/pull/2245)
- New "Add guideline between two points" functionality. It is an Edit menu and context menu item. Contributed by Dec/752986. [PR 2226](https://github.com/fontra/fontra/pull/2226)

## 2025-07-25

- Fixed a serious bug with writing kerning to UFO: group references did not use the correct prefix. [Issue 2238](https://github.com/fontra/fontra/issues/2238), [PR 2239](https://github.com/fontra/fontra/pull/2239)
- [Selection info panel] Added "inline calculator" functionality to the metrics fields. Expressions evaluate to a concrete value once you type enter or leave the field. [Issue 2236](https://github.com/fontra/fontra/issues/2236), [PR 2237](https://github.com/fontra/fontra/pull/2237) Quick rundown:
  - It supports most common operators and parentheses, for example `10 * (5 + 3) / 2`.
  - It allows to use glyph names as variable names, to refer to the metric value for that glyph. For example, if you type `E` in the advance width field, it will take the advance width of the `E` glyph and put that in the field. Likewise, if you type `E` in the left sidebearing field, it will put the left sidebearing value from the `E` glyph in the field.
  - Glyph names can also be used as part of an expression, for example `E + 10`.
  - There is a special notation for the _opposite_ sidebearing, by adding a `!` to the glyph name: if in the _left_ sidebearing field you use `E!` in the expression, it will take the _right_ sidebearing from `E`.

## 2025-07-24

- Read/write guideline.locked flags from/to UFO. [Issue 1390](https://github.com/fontra/fontra/issues/1390), [PR 2235](https://github.com/fontra/fontra/pull/2235)
- Allow glyph guidelines to be selected anywhere along the line, instead of just at their anchor point. [PR 2234](https://github.com/fontra/fontra/pull/2234)

## 2025-07-23

- [Selection info panel] Improved the sidebearing fields (advance, left sidebearing, right sidebearing) to alternatively accept a glyph name, to copy the value from. For example, if you enter `A` in the left sidebearing field, the left sidebearing from glyph `A` is copied into the field, once you type enter or leave the field otherwise. [Issue 2230](https://github.com/fontra/fontra/issues/2230), [PR 2231](https://github.com/fontra/fontra/pull/2231)
- [fontra-pak] New contributor sintfar fixed an issue that in some cases caused an error dialog to appear when exiting Fontra Pak on Windows. [fontra-pak PR 178](https://github.com/fontra/fontra-pak/pull/178)

## 2025-07-16

- [Kerning tool] Changed delete vs. alt-delete behavior: plain delete will now delete the selected kerning pairs across the entire designspace. Alt-delete will only delete the selected kerning pairs for the currently selected source location. [PR 2224](https://github.com/fontra/fontra/pull/2224)

## 2025-07-15

- Implemented a special placeholder notation `/?` for the text entry field, which will be substituted by the "current glyph". This is handy when spacing, kerning, or just looking at the current glyph in different context. Largely contributed by Gaëtan Baehr. [Issue 2198](https://github.com/fontra/fontra/issues/2198), [PR 2206](https://github.com/fontra/fontra/pull/2206) Some notes:
  - When deselecting the current glyph (by clicking elsewhere), the "current glyph" is not reset, but kept.
  - The glyph search panel can be used to change the "current glyph", even if there's no glyph selected in the canvas.
  - The "select next/previous glyph" shortcuts work on the "current glyph", even if there's no glyph selected in the canvas.

- Added a new Sidebearing tool, as a companion to the Kerning tool. Both tools occupy the same slot in the toolbar, with the Sidebearing tool being the default. [Issue 2213](https://github.com/fontra/fontra/issues/2213), [PR 2216](https://github.com/fontra/fontra/pull/2216) Quick intro:
  - Hover over a glyph to see the sidebearing and advance values.
  - Click-drag near a sidebearing to move it
  - Click-drag on the glyph shape to move the glyph within its "advance area".
  - Use shift-click to select multiple sidebearings.
  - Clicking on the glyph shape is equivalent to selecting the left sidebearing and the right sidebearing together.
  - When dragging multiple sidebearings across multiple glyphs, the sidebearings all move with the pointer.
  - Use the alt key to make opposite sidebearings move in opposite directions. For example, if you drag a right sidebearing to the right while holding the alt key, selected left side bearings move to the left, and vice versa.
  - Using the alt key while dragging the glyph shape will increase or decrease both sidebearings.
  - Arrow keys can use used to nudge selected sidebearings.
  - Shift-arrow key will increment/decrement sidebearing values in steps of 10.
  - The tab key can be used to navigate to the next sidebearing. Shift-tab will navigate to the previous sidebearing.
- Some minor changes to the Kerning tool that we done in [PR 2216](https://github.com/fontra/fontra/pull/2216):
  - The cursor used for dragging is now a left-right arrow, to be more in line with the Sidebearing tool.
  - The tab key can now be used to navigate to the next kerning pair. Shift-tab will navigate to the previous kerning pair.

- New features in the glyph sources list:
  - The glyph sources are now sorted according to the axes (they used to be in creation order)
  - The _default_ source's name is now rendered in bold, so it's easier to find
  - For each _font source_ location ("global location") for which the glyph does _not_ have a source, there is now a "virtual source" in the list, rendered in gray. To create an _actual_ source at that location, either double-click the virtual source, or, while the virtual source is selected, start modifying the glyph.

## 2025-03-05

There have been some major changes in the front end, in order to have a clearer separation between the Python server code and the front end. This makes the front-end usable independently from the server.

- All front end code and assets moved to a new folder, `src-js`
- A bundler (webpack) is now used to package assets and code
  - To run the bundler once: `npm run bundle`
  - To run the bundler in "watch" mode (updates bundle on changes): `npm run bundle-watch`
  - Or start the server with the new `--dev` option, which runs `npm run bundle-watch` in the background. For example:
    - `fontra --dev filesystem path/to/fonts/`
  - `pip install path/to/fontra/` will run the bundler implicitly
- Similar changes were made in the `fontra-rcjk` repository
- Fontra Pak was adjusted to these changes as well

## 2024-11-20

- Add support for background image colorization [PR 1815](https://github.com/fontra/fontra/pull/1815)

## 2024-11-18

New feature: background images.

A background image can be added to a glyph in three ways:

- Paste image data
- Drop an image file onto the canvas
- Choose an image file from the user's hard drive, with the "Glyph" -> "Add background image..." menu.

The image file or data can be in PNG or JPEG format.

The glyph needs to be in edit mode, and at a selected source (not at an interpolation).

Fontra's background image feature is mostly compatible with UFO background images, although it doesn't implement UFO's colorization feature yet. Fontra does allow the opacity of the image to be set.

Background images are locked by default, and can be unlocked with the "Unlock background images" context menu item.

Selected background images can be moved around by dragging, and they participate in the Selection Transformation panel's operations.

The Selection Info panel shows the settings for a selected background image: the Opacity can be edited there and the Transformation settings can be edited numerically there.

Caveat: support for background images is limited to the `.designspace`/`.ufo` and `.fontra` backends. It is currently not supported in the `rcjk` backend.
