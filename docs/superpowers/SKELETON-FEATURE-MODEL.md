# Skeleton Feature Model (forkra)

**Reframed:** 2026-07-25 — from a donor-code review into a description of
**forkra's own** skeleton code, verified against the tree.
**Companion to** `FEATURE-ARCHITECTURE-MAP.md`: that doc says *where* the
skeleton files are and *who owns them*; this one is the conceptual **mental
model** — what the feature is, how the generation pipeline works, and which
behaviors must be preserved when you touch it. The design *rationale* (C1–C4,
the defects it answers) lives in the map's §9.

Line numbers drift; **function names are the durable anchors** here. Verify
against the code before relying on any specific location (`skeleton-generator.js`
alone is ~5,200 lines).

## 1. What the feature is

Stroke-based glyph design. Instead of drawing filled outlines directly, the
designer draws **centerline contours** ("skeletons") — ordinary point/handle
paths — and attaches a **stroke width** to each on-curve point. The filled
outline contours are generated live: every edit regenerates the outline. The
generated contours are ordinary path contours (they export, interpolate and
render like hand-drawn ones); the skeleton itself lives in
`customData["fontra.internal"].skeleton` and is invisible to any consumer that
doesn't know about it.

Everything else is elaboration of that one idea:

- **Ribs** — the width at a point, drawn as a bar across the centerline,
  draggable at both endpoints.
- **Caps** — how open ends close: `butt` / `round` / `square` / **`drop`**
  (forkra added the drop cap), each parameterized.
- **Corner rounding** — sharp outline corners from non-smooth skeleton points,
  rounded per point, asymmetrically per side.
- **Editable generated geometry** — individual generated outline points and
  handles can be marked editable and offset from their computed positions
  (nudges, handle offsets, detached handles) while remaining *generated*.
- **Single-sided contours** — all width on one side; the other lies exactly on
  the skeleton.
- **Modifier behaviors** — D (fixed-rib), S (fixed-rib-compress), X (equalize),
  Z (tangent-only rib drag), held as realtime keys during drags.
- **Tunni points** on skeleton curve segments.
- **Per-source defaults** — new points inherit widths/caps from source-level
  settings, keyed by glyph case.

## 2. The data model

Schema and accessors live in `fontra-core/src/skeleton-model.js`. The
load-bearing choice is **stable ids**: contours and points carry ids that
selection, provenance and undo reference instead of array indices, so structural
edits can't silently retarget them (arch map §9).

Per on-curve point: `x, y, smooth`, width fields, `nudge` (tangential rib-end
displacement), `editable` flags per side, cap params, corner params
(`cornerRoundness`, `cornerAsymmetry`, reach), rib-angle overrides, and generated
handle offsets/detached flags. Off-curve points are `{x, y, type: "cubic"}`.

**The width of a side is a fallback cascade, not a stored value** — and it
survived the port (`getPointHalfWidth` / `getPointWidth`,
`skeleton-generator.js:264,284`):

```
halfWidth = point.<side>Width  ??  point.width / 2  ??  contour.defaultWidth / 2
```

This matters: a point with no width fields is a *live consumer* of the contour
default — change `defaultWidth` and un-overridden points follow. Keep this
cascade intact; materializing widths onto every point silently kills it. (An
earlier normalization draft did exactly that; the current code does not.)

## 3. The generation pipeline

`generateFromSkeleton(skeletonData)` (`skeleton-generator.js:51`) is the entry
point: it loops contours (`generateContoursFromSkeleton`) and, per contour, runs
`generateOutlineFromSkeletonContour` (`:1322`), then **emits forward
provenance** — `annotateGeneratedContourProvenance` stamps every generated point
with `{skeletonPointId, side, role}` (arch map C3). The per-contour pipeline is
pure and independent (contour *i*'s output depends only on contour *i*):

1. **Segmentation** — `buildSegmentsFromPoints` splits the point list into
   on-curve→on-curve segments carrying their off-curve controls.
2. **Per-segment offsetting** — each side's outline is offset by its half-width.
   Line segments project endpoints along the rib normal (`applyNudgeToRibPoint`
   applies nudges). Cubic segments keep skeleton handle directions and construct
   handle lengths with `λ = 1 + d·κ` in `offset-cubic.js`, followed by one fixed
   least-squares correction pass; endpoints remain the exact rib positions; user
   handle offsets apply via
   `applyHandleOffsetToControlPoint`. A side under ~0.5 units ("collapsed") skips
   all of this and copies the skeleton verbatim — this is what makes single-sided
   contours exact.
3. **Corner rounding** — `roundSharpCornersOnSide` replaces non-smooth generated
   corners with an arc (two on-curves + handles). Corner metadata rides on the
   generated on-curve points (`buildGeneratedOnCurve`) and is stripped before
   output (`stripCornerRoundMetadata`). A pairwise pass shrinks adjacent trims so
   they can't overlap.
4. **Caps** (open contours) — butt / round / square / drop, built from the two
   side ends plus tip points; handle lengths come from a tension parameter.
5. **Assembly** — `left + endCap + reverse(right) + startCap` → one closed
   contour (`reverseContour`). Closed skeletons instead emit **two** contours
   (outer + counter-wound inner).
6. **Smoothing** — `enforceSmoothColinearity` re-collinearizes handle pairs
   around smooth on-curves. When both handles descend from the same skeleton
   point they carry the axis they were constructed on (`_axis`, stamped at
   emission, stripped with `_provenance`) and `sharedLockedAxis` uses it
   directly. Only handles without that axis — caps, line-segment ribs,
   corner-rounding output — fall back to the length-weighted, rotation-capped
   estimate.

   **The axis must not be derived from handle length.** Rib width changes
   generated handle length, so a length-weighted axis rotates whenever width
   changes: measured at 1.1° mean and 12.5° worst per single unit of width
   before the axis was taken from the skeleton. Deriving it from the *rounded*
   handle positions is the same trap, because the grid snap is what makes the
   direction length-dependent in the first place. Locked in by
   "keeps the smooth-junction handle axis independent of rib width".

   This pass writes handle positions **unrounded**, deliberately: re-snapping
   to the grid here would undo the colinearity it just established, and worst
   on short handles, where a unit of rounding is a large angle.

**Grid rounding happens at every stage**, not once at the end. It is also what
makes handle *direction* length-dependent: a handle emitted at
`round(ribPoint + axis · length)` carries its axis only to within
`atan(0.7 / length)` — about 1.3° at 32 units, 4° at 10, and 45° at 1, where the
eight lattice neighbours are the only directions expressible at all. So any
later stage that re-derives a direction from rounded coordinates inherits a
width dependence, because width sets the length.

**Known issue — handles at the minimum length lose their direction.** The
1-unit floor (`MIN_HANDLE_LENGTH`, plus the `Math.max(along, 1)` clamp in
`projectHandleOntoDirection`) combined with the grid snap reproduces the
8-direction quantization that deleting `lockNearZeroHandleDirection` was meant
to remove. At smooth junctions this no longer shows, because the axis comes from
the skeleton and is applied unrounded (§3.6). Elsewhere a floored handle still
points at a lattice neighbour. The floor fires whenever the offset is at or past
its cusp (`d·κ ≤ −1`), i.e. rib half-width at or beyond the skeleton's radius of
curvature — genuinely degenerate geometry, but the emitted direction there is
arbitrary rather than merely short. Fixing it means choosing between a larger
floor and sub-unit handle coordinates; not yet decided.

**Point-count stability is a hard constraint.** The generated point count must
stay constant across parameter values, or cross-master interpolation breaks. Any
change to outline geometry must preserve it (arch map §8 delegation recipe).

## 4. How forkra differs from the donor (the redesign)

forkra re-integrated the feature; it did **not** merge the donor's plumbing. The
donor still sits read-only at **`_external/skeleton`** (pinned at `fd76d3abe`,
gitignored) as a behavioral reference — `git -C _external/skeleton …` — never a
source to copy plumbing from. Three differences are load-bearing and must not be
undone (full rationale: arch map §9):

- **One write path.** All editing-side mutation flows through `editSkeleton`
  (`skeleton-editing.js`), the only caller of the generator on the edit side.
  The donor mutated from dozens of call sites; forkra does not.
- **Forward provenance, never geometric recovery.** "Which skeleton point owns
  this generated point?" is a provenance-map lookup. The donor reverse-mapped by
  re-projecting ribs and comparing coordinates with tolerances; **none of that is
  in forkra** — do not reintroduce it.
- **Modifiers inside the behavior model.** D/S/X/Z are behavior names and
  executor variants, not the inline pointer branches / bypass flags the donor
  used (which regressed equalize five times).

## 5. What must be preserved

Losing any of these regresses the product:

- **The width fallback cascade** (§2) — one-field "reweight this whole contour."
- **The collapsed-side rule** (§3.2) — a side under ~0.5 units lies exactly on
  the skeleton; this is what makes single-sided and open-counter constructions
  predictable.
- **Corner metadata riding on generated points** (`buildGeneratedOnCurve` →
  `roundSharpCornersOnSide`) — a per-skeleton-point parameter acting at the right
  place in outline space, after both sides exist. It's also the natural carrier
  for provenance.
- **Pairwise corner-trim limiting** — stops adjacent rounded corners eating each
  other; easy to lose in a reimplementation.
- **Point-count stability** across parameter values (§3) — the interpolation
  contract.
- **The rules-tables interaction feel** — skeleton points behave exactly like
  path points under Shift/Alt because they run the same rules (C1). This is the
  feature's best UX decision.

## 6. Known cleanup candidates (verified in the current tree)

Not bugs — carried-over cruft and structural weight. Each is verified present
today; treat as opportunities, not mandates, and confirm before acting.

- **Round-once opportunity.** Grid quantization at every pipeline stage (§3) is
  the reason `lockNearZeroHandleDirection`, the `NEAR_ZERO_*` constants and the
  rotation clamp exist. Keeping interior handles in floats and rounding once at
  the boundary (`outlineContourToPackedPath`) would let several defensive
  subsystems shrink. Larger change; measure first.
- **The generator is the monolith.** `skeleton-generator.js` at ~5,200 lines is
  defect **P6** (arch map §9) still biting — the single largest file in the fork.

(The donor's dead `mergeCap` branches and `generateSampledOffsetPoints` are
already absent from forkra — nothing to do there.)
